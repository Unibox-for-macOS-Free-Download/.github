## ❓ What is Unibox?

**Unibox** for macOS is a minimalist email client that completely rethinks how you manage email. Instead of organizing by threads or folders, Unibox arranges messages by contact — making your inbox feel like a messaging app.

It’s sleek, intuitive, and distraction-free. The app lets you manage multiple accounts, supports drag-and-drop file sharing, and uses a unified inbox. Ideal for people who want a simple, personal connection with their email flow.

Unibox is native to macOS and runs smoothly on **Apple Silicon** (M1/M2/M3) as well as **Intel Macs**. It’s lightweight, works offline, and integrates tightly with the macOS system.
